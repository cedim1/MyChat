# Overview
This python program is a basic chatbot.
# Make it your own
This has the ability to learn, go into the code and go onto the 'prompts list'. edit the list so that it says your prompt (The thing that you say) seperate it with a comma
and then insert your response (The thing the chatbot says in response to your prompt.) aterward, for example if you wanted it to go Yay when you say I have a trophy, it looks
ike this; "I have a trophy", "Yay"
#### NOTE
Make sure that this is inside the two square brackets (pompt = [Inside here])
